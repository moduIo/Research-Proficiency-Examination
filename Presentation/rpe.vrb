\begin{itemize}
	\item The Student-Teacher network incorporates logical rules as a regularization term over the objective function.
	\item This general framework can be applied in any context where some common sense knowledge may be useful.
	\item TensorLog gives a differentiable probabilistic logical inference procedure which may be used as a component in a DNN.
	\item The parameters of TensorLog models lose the interpretation as probabilities but may be trained via SGD (as opposed to EM).
\end{itemize}
