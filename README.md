# Probabilistic Logic and Deep Learning
This work introduces key ideas in Statistical Relational Learning including: Belief Propagation, Markov Logic Networks, Probabilistic Logic Programming, Expectation Maximization (EM), Logical Hidden Markov Models, and an introduction to Deep Learning.

Following this introductary material, we discuss two neural architectures which utilize relational (logical) information.
